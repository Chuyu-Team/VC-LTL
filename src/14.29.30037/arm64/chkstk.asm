;
; Routine Description:
;
;   This function provides runtime stack checking for local allocations
;   that are more than a page and for storage dynamically allocated with
;   the alloca function. Stack checking consists of probing downward in
;   the stack a page at a time. If the current stack commitment is exceeded,
;   then the system will automatically attempts to expand the stack. If the
;   attempt succeeds, then another page is committed. Otherwise, a stack
;   overflow exception is raised. It is the responsibility of the caller to
;   handle this exception.
;
;   N.B. This routine is called using a non-standard calling sequence since
;        it is typically called from within the prologue. The allocation size
;        argument is in register x15, and is divided by 16.
;
;        The typical calling sequence from the prologue is:
;
;        mov    x15, #immed                ; set requested stack frame size
;        bl     __chkstk                  ; verify stack
;        sub    sp, sp, x15, lsl #4        ; apply stack adjust
;
; Arguments:
;
;   None.
;
; Implicit Arguments:
;
;   Allocation (x15) - Supplies the size of the allocation on the stack, divided by 16.
;
; Return Value:
;
;   None.
